# Luvit-Scripts
A repo for some of my unassorted Luvit scripts.

<details>
  <summary><h2>fetsh.lua</h2></summary>
  
  A script that attempts to get some of your system info and display it in the output.  
  Should in theory work on both Windows and Linux, but perfect linux support is not guaranteed due to my limited testing environments.  
  
  Lines `11-29` contain "config" values that are ok to change.
  
  ### Tested Systems
  - Windows
    - [x] 11 Pro (22H2)
  - Linux
    - [x] Ubuntu 20.04.2 (Linux 5.19.0)
